# Performance Tuning

> **🚧 Under Construction**: This section is being developed. Check back later for detailed performance optimization guidelines.

This page will cover performance optimization techniques for synapse.

## Coming Soon

This section will include:

- **Benchmarking** - How to measure and benchmark your code
- **Memory Optimization** - Reducing memory allocations and garbage collection pressure
- **Concurrency** - Effective use of goroutines and channels
- **Profiling** - Using Go's profiling tools to identify bottlenecks
- **Caching Strategies** - When and how to implement caching
- **Resource Pooling** - Reusing expensive resources
- **Algorithm Selection** - Choosing the right algorithms for your use case

## Performance Best Practices

While we develop this section, here are some general tips:

1. **Profile Before Optimizing** - Always measure before making changes
2. **Focus on Hot Paths** - Optimize the code that runs most frequently
3. **Benchmark Regularly** - Track performance over time
4. **Consider Trade-offs** - Balance performance with code maintainability

## Benchmarking Basics

Use Go's built-in benchmarking:

```bash
go test -bench=. -benchmem
```
